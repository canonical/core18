    # XXX: snapcraft by default doesn't stage hidden (.) files and directories,
    # so we need to explicitly list the .disk file for it to get staged/primed.
    stage: [.disk, ./*]
    prime: [.disk, ./*]
    # XXX: Dirty hacks to enable building core18 on non-bionic systems.
    # Without these overrides both the PATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH contain paths
    # in the part's install directory which binaries can be incompatible with
    # the ones running on our system.  We don't need those while running stage
    # and prime anyway.
